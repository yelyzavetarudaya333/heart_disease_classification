# Heart Disease Classification 
In this project I will apply different ML models to the UCI Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data.

The problem statement:
 - to predict based on the given attributes of a patient that whether that particular person has heart disease or not and other is the experimental task to diagnose.
 
The goal of this project:
 - practice building logistic regression, support vector classifier and decision tree using Scikit-learn;
 - compare these models on this particular task;
 - try implementing GridSearchCV on SVC;
 - try implementing cost complexity pruning on decision tree and visualize different alphas.
